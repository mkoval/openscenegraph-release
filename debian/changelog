  [Alberto Luaces]
  * New upstream release.
  * Updated standards version (3.9.4).
  * Updated SVN URL.
  * Removed the static version of the libraries since they impose a huge
    load on the build servers, add additional complexity on the build
    scripts, and make a great impact on the size of the packages, given
    the very small cases where they are useful.
  * Acknowledge NMU.

    fine.
  * Removed openthreads-doc since OpenThreads documentation is shared with

    - debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
    - out-of-date-standards-version (updated from 3.8.0 to 3.8.4)

    CPUs are available, fixing the FTBFS (due to -j0) on various platforms
    (Closes: #477353). The right way to do it is to support parallel=n in
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (see Debian Policy ¬ß4.9.1), and adequate support has
    been implemented.

    whitespaces (Policy CMP0004 say the logs), thanks to Andreas Putzo who
    provided it (Closes: #482239):

openscenegraph (2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update debian/patches/openscenegraph.dpatch accordingly.
  * Fix installation of .so according to the SONAME bump:
     - debian/libopenscenegraph6.files still contained libosg*.so.6*
       references, which are now bumped. That problem was introduced in
       2.1.9-1.
  * Move from dh_movefiles to dh_install:
     - debian/*.files renamed as debian/*.install.
     - use ‚Äúdh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdh_movefiles‚Äù.
     - remove the previous ‚Äúdh_install -p openscenegraph‚Äù call accordingly.
     - modify debian/rules to copy OpenSceneGraph/examples under debian/tmp,
       and update debian/openscenegraph.install accordingly.
     - also use ‚Äú--fail-missing‚Äù to catch files not installed anywhere, and
       avoid the kind of errors mentioned above.
  * Add lintian override:
     - located under debian/lintian/, the only one being there is for
       libopenscenegraph6, which holds multiple shared objects.
     - adapted debian/rules a bit to install it (eventually them) easily.
  * Adjust clean rule:
     - upstream ships an executable C++ source file, which permission is
       removed in the clean target.
  * Adjust manpages (debian/*.1):
     - use ‚Äú\-\-help‚Äù instead of ‚Äú--help‚Äù to fix hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
       reported by lintian.
     - add osgdepthpeeling.1 to MANEXAMPLES.
