The `openscenegraph-examples' package is just a convenience source bundle for learning and inspecting the code of the examples shipped with OSG and whose binaries belong to the `openscenegraph' package. As they are simple examples, you can compile them in most of the cases with the command

g++ <example-file-names> $(pkg-config openscenegraph --libs) $(pkg-config openthreads --libs)
